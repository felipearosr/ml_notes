# Machine Learning
## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is often misunderstood, partly due to its recent successes and media hype. It involves using statistical, mathematical, and numerical methods to extract knowledge from data, which can help with summarization, visualization, grouping, or prediction. However, it has its limitations and cannot replace critical thinking and systematic work in data science. Machine learning is a mix of various disciplines, including statistics and mathematics, and this repository provides a summary of its basics and a collection of tools for specific problems.
## How *deep* do I want to go?

I want to gain three levels of understanding about Machine Learning.

1. Be aware of the different types of problems that ML techniques can solve.
2. After identifying the appropriate ML technique for a problem, being able to understand how it achieves the desired outcome.
3. Understand the math behind it.
### Harvard Machine Learning Framework, the *CUBE*

The Machine Learning Cube is a framework to categorize ML problems and techniques. The cube has three axes:

1. **Output Domain**
	- Discrete: Categorical data, such as gender or state names.
    - Continuous: Data on the real number line.
2. **Statistical Nature**
    - Probabilistic: Incorporates data through statistical distributions and can discard data post-model tuning.
    - Non-probabilistic: Uses data directly for actions, requires retaining data, and may be slower at runtime.
3. **Type of Training**
    
    - Supervised: Uses input-output data pairs for training (e.g., weather conditions and crop production).
    - Unsupervised: Uses only input data for summarization or clustering.

Understanding these axes helps to grasp machine learning concepts and techniques.
