A major component of machine learning involves making predictions about a target based on inputs, like predicting an individual's lifetime earnings from demographic data. This chapter focuses on predicting continuous, real numbers, a process known as regression.
## Defining the Problem

To understand regression, consider the types of problems it solves: 
1. Predicting a person's height from their parents' heights.
2. Estimating loan repayment time based on credit history.
3. Forecasting package arrival time given weather and traffic conditions.

Regression involves making predictions for continuous outputs based on given inputs. It's a class of methods used to achieve this goal, not a single technique.
